## Advanced Integration Patterns

### 1. Conditional Alerts Setup

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "live-conditions": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/live-conditions-app/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "BACKEND_API_URL": "http://localhost:5000",
        "AUTO_SUBSCRIBE_ALERTS": "true",
        "DEFAULT_ALERT_RADIUS": "25",
        "ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL": "https://your-app.com/webhooks/alerts"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Multi-Location Monitoring

Configure for monitoring multiple locations:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "live-conditions": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/live-conditions-app/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "BACKEND_API_URL": "http://localhost:5000",
        "MONITORED_LOCATIONS": "Sydney,Melbourne,Brisbane,Auckland,Wellington",
        "ENABLE_MULTI_LOCATION_SUMMARY": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Conversation Starters

Here are useful conversation starters to demonstrate MCP server capabilities:

### Weather & Conditions
- "What's the weather like in [city] right now?"
- "Will it rain in [location] this weekend?"
- "What's the temperature difference between Sydney and Melbourne?"

### Marine & Surf
- "Are the surf conditions good at [beach] today?"
- "What time is high tide at [location]?"
- "Is it safe to go swimming at [beach] now?"

### Safety & Alerts  
- "Are there any emergency alerts in my area?"
- "Is it safe to drive from [A] to [B] today?"
- "What's the fire danger rating in [region]?"

### Travel & Traffic
- "What's the traffic like on [highway/route]?"
- "When should I leave to avoid traffic from [A] to [B]?"
- "Are there any road closures between [origin] and [destination]?"

### Data Analysis
- "Can you summarize today's conditions across Australia?"
- "What's the air quality like in major cities?"
- "Which beaches have the best conditions this weekend?"

## Troubleshooting Integration Issues

### Server Not Starting

1. **Check the path**: Ensure the path to `dist/index.js` is correct
2. **Verify Node.js**: Make sure Node.js 18+ is installed
3. **Check permissions**: Ensure the file is executable
4. **Review logs**: Check Claude Desktop logs for error messages

### Backend Connection Issues

1. **Verify backend URL**: Ensure `BACKEND_API_URL` is accessible
2. **Check network**: Test API connectivity manually
3. **Review timeouts**: Increase `API_TIMEOUT` if needed
4. **Check logs**: Review MCP server logs for connection errors

### Performance Issues

1. **Adjust cache settings**: Increase `CACHE_TTL` for better performance
2. **Monitor memory**: Check for memory leaks in long-running sessions
3. **Rate limiting**: Ensure you're not hitting API rate limits
4. **Network latency**: Consider using a local backend instance

### Data Freshness Issues

1. **Check data sources**: Verify external API connectivity
2. **Review cache**: Clear cache if data seems stale
3. **Monitor updates**: Check data source update frequencies
4. **Validate timestamps**: Ensure timezone handling is correct

## Best Practices

### 1. Resource Management
- Use caching to reduce API calls
- Implement proper error handling
- Monitor memory usage in long sessions

### 2. User Experience
- Provide clear, actionable information
- Include timestamps for data freshness
- Offer alternative options when conditions are poor

### 3. Safety First
- Always include safety warnings for outdoor activities
- Provide emergency contact information
- Prioritize official alert sources

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Use appropriate cache TTL values
- Batch requests when possible
- Implement graceful degradation

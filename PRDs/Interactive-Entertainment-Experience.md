Inspiration 2: The Interactive Entertainment Experience
Product Idea: "The Trans-Tasman Live Quiz"
Elevator Pitch: A weekly, live-hosted quiz show optimised for mobile, where thousands of Australians and New Zealanders compete against each other in real-time for prizes and bragging rights.

Problem Statement: People enjoy trivia and game shows (like Have You Been Paying Attention? or The Chase), but the experience is passive. There's a desire for a large-scale, interactive event that creates a shared "moment" without needing to be in a physical pub.

The "Live" Element:

Live video broadcast of a charismatic host.

Real-time, synchronised questions pushed to all players' devices.

Live leaderboard that updates after every question.

Live chat/reaction feed.

Core Features (MVP):

Player App: Simple interface with a video window, question/answer area, and chat.

Live Backend: System to push questions, calculate scores, and manage leaderboards in real-time with minimal latency.

Host Interface: A dashboard for the host to see player counts, manage the question flow, and view chat highlights.

Scheduled Events: A clear schedule for the "live shows" (e.g., "Every Thursday at 8 PM AEST / 10 PM NZST").

Success Metrics:

Peak concurrent players per show.

Player retention rate (percentage of players who return for the next show).

Average session duration.

AU/NZ Specific Angle: Capitalises on the friendly rivalry between the two nations. Questions can be tailored with local trivia, inside jokes, and categories like "Holden or Ford?", "Pavlova: Ours or Yours?", and "Name the All Black."

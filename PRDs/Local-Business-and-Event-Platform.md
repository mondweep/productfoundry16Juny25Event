The Local Business & Events Platform
Product Idea: "On The Shout"
Elevator Pitch: A live discovery platform where local businesses (pubs, cafes, food trucks) can post instant, time-limited deals, and users can see what's happening around them right now.

Problem Statement: For users, it's hard to find spontaneous, last-minute things to do or deals to grab. For small businesses, platforms like Instagram are noisy, and running a formal promotion is a hassle. They need a way to say, "We have 10 extra pies to sell cheap in the next hour!" or "Live music is starting in 15 minutes!"

The "Live" Element:

All deals and events have a short, visible countdown timer (e.g., "Expires in 45 minutes").

The map and feed are strictly chronological and location-based, showing only what's active now or in the very near future.

Core Features (MVP):

User View: A map and a feed showing active "shouts" (deals/events) nearby.

Business Portal: An incredibly simple web or app interface for verified businesses to post a shout: Title, Description, Discount (optional), and Duration (e.g., 1-3 hours).

Redemption System: A simple "Show this screen" or a one-time tap-to-redeem button for tracking.

Category Filters: Let users filter for food, drinks, entertainment, etc.

Success Metrics:

Number of businesses signed up and actively posting.

Number of deals "claimed" or viewed by users.

Growth in user base in key metro areas (e.g., Sydney, Auckland, Wellington, Brisbane).

AU/NZ Specific Angle: The name "The Shout" is a well-understood cultural term for treating someone. It taps into the strong cafe and pub culture and the growing desire to "support local" businesses, especially post-pandemic. Itâ€™s perfect for the spontaneous, social nature of Aussies and Kiwis.
